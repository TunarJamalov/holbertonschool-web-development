# 🌐 Semantic HTML Homepage – Figma to Code

This project is the **first step** in a series of frontend development tasks where we translate a visual design into a working webpage. In this stage, we focus exclusively on the **HTML structure**—no CSS, JavaScript, or styling is included. Our goal is to implement **clean, semantic, accessible HTML** that mirrors the layout and content of the provided design.

## 🎯 Project Objective

* Recreate the homepage from the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?node-id=3558-0&t=QEHs3UaMwapUeVTU-0)
* Focus solely on **semantic HTML** and correct document structure
* Lay a strong foundation for future CSS and interactivity
* Ensure accessibility and responsiveness are considered at the structure level

## 🔗 Figma File

> 💡 To view the full design, **duplicate the file to your drafts** in Figma:

## 🧱 Structure Overview

The HTML structure is divided into semantic sections as observed in the Figma design:

* `<header>` 
* `<main>` 
* `<footer>` 

Each section uses semantic tags such as:

* `<section>`
* `<nav>`
* `<h1>`–`<h6>`, `<p>`

## 📁 File Structure

```
semantic-homepage/
├── index.html       # The main HTML file (no CSS or JS)
├── README.md        # Project documentation
```

---

## ✅ Semantic HTML Principles Used

* **Accessibility:** Use of `alt` attributes on images, correct heading hierarchy, landmark tags.
* **SEO-Friendly:** Logical content flow, appropriate use of metadata (to be added later).
* **Clean Code:** Indented, human-readable HTML with comments indicating structure.
* **No Styling:** This is a pure HTML-only version; styling will be introduced in later phases.

---

## 🚧 Notes

* Some values in Figma are floats (e.g., `23.7px`). These have been **rounded** where appropriate.
* Placeholder text and images are used where specific content isn't yet finalized.
* Classes and IDs are **kept minimal or absent** unless necessary for structure or accessibility.

---

## 📌 Next Steps

In upcoming phases:

* Add **responsive CSS styles**
* Integrate **JavaScript functionality**
* Improve accessibility with **ARIA roles and keyboard navigation**
* Optimize performance and SEO
